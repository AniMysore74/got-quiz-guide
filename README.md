#Quizzing Guide for ASOIAF 

This is a handy web app for extreme ASOIAF quizzers. Lets you search for initials, hangmen, and anagrams.

##Planned features
 
 1. Search any book quotes by **initials** - Running a `javascript` search query on such a large file seems to crash the browser. Looking for solutions.
 2. More categories - Scroll down to see the database status.
 3. **Lightning** mode - Simple one box search, with no categories.
